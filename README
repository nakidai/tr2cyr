NAME
     tr2cyr - Convert transliteration into cyrillic text

DESCRIPTION
     Just simple tool I made because I have nothing to do.

     Well, because of meeting some comments about non-intuitive table of
     translation, I should say that tr2cyr is intended to be used first of all
     in tools in my environment, when I don't have access to Russian layout.
     The purpose of this tool is to provide an ability to make any combination
     of cyrillic characters.  Also, I didn't want to complicate the tool.  So
     I created tr2cyr that way in the end.
